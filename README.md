# JavaWebStack Autobahn

This project uses the [Autobahn test suite](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-testsuite) to run tests against the JavaWebStack [HTTP-Client](https://github.com/JavaWebStack/http-client) and verifies the WebSocket implementation.  
Disclaimer: This is just a simple project to help with debugging and fixing errors. It will help us to integrate the functionality into JUnit tests of the HTTP-Client.
